## Problem Set 3

#Chapter 6

4. a. iii - In order to minimize the equation with increasing lambda, the B coefficients must converge to 0.

b. ii - Decrease then increase. With lamba = 0, test RSS is high because of overfitting. As lambda increases
overfitting is reduce to a point until the increased shrinkage becomes inefficient.

c. iv - As lambda increases, the B coefficients converge on zero. All betas = 0 is essentially a horizontal line with no variance.

d. iii - Increasing lambda decreases flexibility, which increases bias. 

e. v - irreducible error is a horizontal line, a constant, that can not be improved regardless of model fit.
